Welcome to my portfolio webpage! 
This project includes HTML pages for the home, about, skills, portfolio, contact, and review sections, 
along with corresponding CSS and JavaScript files to style and add interactivity to the pages. 
The home page serves as an introduction, providing visitors with an overview of who I am and what I do. 
The about page offers more detailed information about my background and experience. On the skills page, 
you'll find a list of my technical skills and proficiencies. 
The portfolio page showcases some of my previous multi media projects, giving visitors a glimpse into my work. 
The contact page provides a means for visitors to reach out to me. Finally, the review page displays testimonials and feedback from my lecturer. 
Feel free to explore the various sections and get in touch if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration!
